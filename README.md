<p>You no longer have to search down those crazy paths!</p>
<p>Added because I care about the long term support of my users</p>
<p>Added mostly because your boy now has 2 locations to slap  </br>
   my <strike>gross</strike> <bold>scurvy laden</bold> download files all over my computer, and   </br>
   on different drives no less! This fixes all of those pesky </br>
   little problems. At no cost to you! (Yet...)
</p>

## Q And A

Q - Will this work for me? </br>
A - Should.

Q - Are you adding more to this? </br>
A - I am actively removing features that are broken actually.

Q - Is it safe to download </br>
A - I can give you the code I guess.

Q - Is it safe to move large files with? </br>
A - Probably, don't turn off ur pc :yikes:

Q - What Happens if I spam buttons or press the "Enter" key a ton in the text fields </br>
A - It will crash, thank you for asking

Open in Explorer\* - Ten or more files will cause quite a bit of lag when opening files with explorer, there </br>
is a prompt to let you know, but you can still go for it if you want.
