## Only tested on Windows 10
That is the OS I have ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è sorry.</br>
It will work on other windows os's because</br>
it's a winforms in C# but unexpected behavior</br>
I have no idea about.

### Currently Working On
  - Sorting out code to make it easier for me
  - Migrating to Rider now that the GUI is mostly done
  - A general clean up
  - Most likely a UI changeup/cleanup

# YAFE
Yet Another File Explorer </br>
Tired of moving all those things out of your downloads folder manually?</br>
Well do I have the thing for you!

![picture of application with contents scanned](https://github.com/SRGTxTwinkie/YAFE/blob/main/Running.png?raw=true)
The UI has changed, and will change more. These screenshots most likey won't be updated until the far future.

Whether it be modding, pictures, or whatever you can quickly and easily move files around.

## Features

- Settings Saved on Window Close
- File Age in Human Readable Days
- Files <= 1 day old will be auto checked
- Quickly open an exe from the UI
- Choice between:

  - Move Items
  - Copy Items
  - Open In Explorer\*

- Manually Timed loading bar, because it felt too fast!


## A quick select/favorite system
![picture of application with favorites menu opened](https://github.com/SRGTxTwinkie/YAFE/blob/main/Favorites.png?raw=true)

<p>You no longer have to search down those crazy paths!</p>
<p>Added because I care about the long term support of my users</p>
<p>Added mostly because your boy now has 2 locations to slap  </br>
   my gross little download files all over my computer, and   </br>
   on different drives no less! This fixes all of those pesky </br>
   little problems. At no cost to you! (Yet...)
</p>    

### Use it for...
  - Neovim/Vim/Emacs/VSCode Plugins
  - Minecraft profile mods
  - Windows/Linux OS Plugins
  - AND SO MUCH MORE!

## Coming Soon....
  - Subscription based model
  - Server Side File Deletion
  - Internet Explorer Support
  - API Bandwith limit
  - AND SO MUCH MORE!

## Q And A

Q - Will this work for me? </br>
A - I have no idea.

Q - Are you adding more to this? </br>
A - I doubt it.

Q - Is it safe to download </br>
A - I can give you the code I guess.

Q - Is it safe to move large files with? </br>
A - Probably IDK.

Q - Have you tested the code extensively </br>
A - No :grin:

Q - What Happens if I spam buttons or press the "Enter" key a ton in the text fields </br>
A - It will crash, thank you for asking

Open in Explorer\* - Ten or more files will cause quite a bit of lag when opening files with explorer, there </br>
is a prompt to let you know, but you can still go for it if you want.
