### Currently Working On
  - Sorting out code to make it easier for me
  - Migrating to Rider now that the GUI is mostly done
  - A general clean up
  - Most likely a UI changeup/cleanup

## A quick select/favorite system
![picture of application with favorites menu opened](https://github.com/SRGTxTwinkie/YAFE/blob/main/Favorites.png?raw=true)

<p>You no longer have to search down those crazy paths!</p>
<p>Added because I care about the long term support of my users</p>
<p>Added mostly because your boy now has 2 locations to slap  </br>
   my gross little download files all over my computer, and   </br>
   on different drives no less! This fixes all of those pesky </br>
   little problems. At no cost to you! (Yet...)
</p>    

### Use it for...
  - Neovim/Vim/Emacs/VSCode Plugins
  - Minecraft profile mods
  - Windows/Linux OS Plugins
  - AND SO MUCH MORE!

## Coming Soon....
  - Subscription based model
  - Server Side File Deletion
  - Internet Explorer Support
  - API Bandwith limit
  - AND SO MUCH MORE!

## Q And A

Q - Will this work for me? </br>
A - I have no idea.

Q - Are you adding more to this? </br>
A - I doubt it bucko.

Q - Is it safe to download </br>
A - I can give you the code I guess.

Q - Is it safe to move large files with? </br>
A - Probably IDK.

Q - Have you tested the code extensively </br>
A - No :grin:

Q - What Happens if I spam buttons or press the "Enter" key a ton in the text fields </br>
A - F\*\*k around and find out I guess :man_shrugging:

Open in Explorer\* - Ten or more files will cause quite a bit of lag when opening files with explorer, there </br>
is a prompt to let you know, but you can still go for it if you want.
